# Praxis-Programming-Game-Project
For Praxis Programming Game Project I decided to recreate flappy bird in the terminal

================ Flappy Bird ================

Pre Play Instructions:

I made this game in VS code with extentions for c 
The code is made in windows and the code uses functions of windows like the windows beep sound and interaction
so thus it is reccomended to use a soft ware program on windows to run this code

------------ HOW TO PLAY ------------

1. copy past the game onto your software which runs c on a windows system.

2. click on run.

3. before the game starts you will be given options to choose the difficulty, pipe color and bird color you can choose to change anything you want and then you can start your game either with custom setting or default, you can also choose to exit the game.

4. for the actual game play its pretty straight forward you click on the space bar to jump your goal is to score the most amount point and try to beat your high score.

5. during gameplay if you wish to close the game you can click on c which will imedetly exit the program.
